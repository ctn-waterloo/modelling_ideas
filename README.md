Nengo model ideas
=================

Ideas for models that could be made with Nengo if anyone has time.

This repository keeps track of all the ideas for models that you get
by talking to people in other labs, going to conferences or by taking long
walks on the beach. Save them here by making an Issue, even if you don't have 
time to implement them, so they don't get lost!

There are two categories of ideas:
- **Basic:** Small projects for students or people who want to get their feet wet with Nengo.
- **Advanced:** For people who have more experience building Nengo models or for models that are larger scale.
